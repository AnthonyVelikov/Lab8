Graceful degradation & service workers both try to ensure that the app is usable even if the normal conditions aren’t present. In graceful degradation you build the full experience but have fallbacks for older browsers or when features don’t work. While service workers are a fallback that ensures assets are loaded even when there is no internet. In both cases the app doesn’t fully break but just degrades when internet or other resources are not present.
